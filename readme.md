## Credits

## Dependencies

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) version 3.8.0

## Code

The main code is contained in the index.html, style.css, and app.js files. The index.html file contains the HTML structure of the webpage, the style.css file contains the styling of the webpage, and the app.js file contains the JavaScript animations that create the text reveal effect.

## Animations

The app.js file uses the GSAP library to create the text reveal effect. The tl variable defines a timeline of animations, with each animation targeting a specific element on the webpage. The timeline includes the following animations:

The hero image scales down and gains rounded corners with an elastic effect.
The text elements "One", "stop", "shop", "to", "perfect", and "skin" move into place with a sliding effect and a slight fade-in.
The "Explore" button slides up and fades in.
The letters of the logo move up from below the screen with a staggered, bouncing effect.
Enjoy the code!
